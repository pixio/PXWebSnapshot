 *  Asynchronously download the objects specified in the list using the specified block.

 *
 *  @discussion This class method is used to perform async operations (such as downloads) mapping a list
 *              of objects to a new list using the specified block.  This mapping could be converting
 *              @c NSStrings or @c NSURLs to images by downloading them, or loading URLs from disk.
 *              Once all the operations complete, the callback is called with the result list.
 *              It is important that ALL calls to @c downloadBlock call the block passed as an argument.
 *              If, for some reason, the operation fails, it is acceptable to pass @c nil to the block,
 *              which will be ignored safely.
 *  @discussion Any blocks which return nil will also not have their object returned to the final callback
 *              in the list of objects.
 *  @discussion The list of @c objects returned along with the completed @c list is in the same order as the 
 *              downloaded output in case the order changed as a result of the download or there were @c nil results.
 *
 *  @param objects       objects to download
 *  @param downloadBlock block which performs a download operation for a specified object
 *  @param completion    completion to call when the list is complete
